Chevalier:
PROS:
-follows + accounts for process(es) of rupture + de-centralizaiton of (structures of) knowledge + (systems of) values
-recognition tht texts do not opperate in a vacuum--challenges "representational individual" mode of organization (p 76)
-potential to filter out "distracting" + obvious modes of organization (e.g. genre) in favor of more specialized modes (e.g. tense usage + word choice) (p 77)
-accounts for arbitrary nature of "innovative shifts" in stylistics etc (p 77)
-tracks when and (potentially, depending on context etc) how influences enter + shift order

CONS:
-does not fully account for arbitrary nature of ~the center~ i.e. can potentially give illusion tht structural centers are forever-fixed points (e.g. elements listed on fig 30) (p 72)
-not critical enough of how "origins" of style etc. are "chosen"/ordered
-not enough attribution to social forces/conditions at play in organization of literary knowledge/history/theory i.e. does not account for effects of Culture Industry + white supremacy at work in determining literary value systems

QUESTIONABLE:
-critical enough of how "style" is created/comes to be ordered/known?
